# Sign-Language-MNIST-classifier-CNN

A CNN with 2 convolutional + Maxpooling layers and a Dense layer finally followed by a softmax layer was used to classify the images from the MNIST Sign Language dataset into 26 classes. Image Augmentation was done via the keras ImageDataGenerator to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting the training set. 

Final Result: After 30 epochs, we secured an accuracy of 95% on the test set.
